Roberts Enterprise Web Application
==================================

## John Harvey, Rawan Alfaraj

### Abstract
One website to host information on three separate businesses owned and operated by the same company. The goal is to provide a convenient, centralized online platform for visitors seeking information about any of the three businesses. Besides hosting, the foundation is built entirely using open source, free software. The core consists of a website development to display general information, help new customers learn more, help current customers manage their rentals, and to make business for the company easier to manage and operate. Our design decisions and implementation have security built in from the beginning.

### Client Background
Roberts Enterprise is located in Three Rivers, Michigan, and operates three local businesses: A campground, a mobile-home park, and an estate park. Before this, there was no online web presence and customers had to call for information. Most of the business was conducted through the mail and over the phone. Having a centralized online platform helps make running the operations faster and easier.

### Design
This application was built using Ruby on Rails, Bootstrap, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, PostgreSQL, LetsEncrypt, and Heroku.
